        # State of the Project
        
        **In active development**   
        Given an input RTL file after-synthesis utilization and timing are extracted.

        # How to inspect the project
        
        This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing dependences and python versions in order to avoid conflicting versions on different machines.
        Following instructions are tested on a Linux machine but should work on OSX with minor (or none) modifications.

        ## Install Poetry
        
        (if you already have poetry installed skip to the next section)   
        Execute the following command in a shell to install poetry
        
            curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
        
        You will find poetry in $HOME/poetry/.bin where $HOME is usually something like *home/your-user-name* (on Linux).
        To check that everything went well run:
        
            poetry --version
        
        If this does not work add the poetry installation directory to the PATH ([instructions](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19062-01/sun.mgmt.ctr36/819-5418/gaznb/index.html) for Linux)

        ## Run an example
        
        Clone this repository to your local machine:
        
            git clone https://github.com/DPaletti/dovado.git
        
        Now position at the project root:
        
            cd dovado
        
        Install all the required dependences:
        
            poetry install
        
        Run an example:
        
            poetry run dovado < examples/fifo_memory/input
        
        Doing so all the program prompts are automatically answered with each line in input (one line = one answer), open it to see the answers.
        After all the vivado output you should see examples&rsquo; WNS (worst negative slack) and LUT (lookup table) percentage utilization
