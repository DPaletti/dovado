    convert covariance matrix to correlation matrix

    Parameters
    ----------
    cov : array_like, 2d
        covariance matrix, see Notes

    Returns
    -------
    corr : ndarray (subclass)
        correlation matrix
    return_std : bool
        If this is true then the standard deviation is also returned.
        By default only the correlation matrix is returned.

    Notes
    -----
    This function does not convert subclasses of ndarrays. This requires that
    division is defined elementwise. np.ma.array and np.matrix are allowed.

    Parameters
    ----------

    std : array_like, 1d
        standard deviation

    -------
