'''This implements a virtual screen. This is used to support ANSI terminal
emulation. The screen representation and state is implemented in this class.
Most of the methods are inspired by ANSI screen control codes. The
:class:`~pexpect.ANSI.ANSI` class extends this class to add parsing of ANSI
escape codes.

    rectangular array. This maintains a virtual cursor position and handles
    scrolling as characters are added. This supports most of the methods needed
    by an ANSI text screen. Row and column indexes are 1-based (not zero-based,
    like arrays).

    Characters are represented internally using unicode. Methods that accept
    input characters, when passed 'bytes' (which in Python 2 is equivalent to
    'str'), convert them from the encoding specified in the 'encoding'
    parameter to the constructor. Methods that return screen contents return
    unicode strings, with the exception of __str__() under Python 2. Passing
    ``encoding=None`` limits the API to only accept unicode input, so passing
    bytes in will raise :exc:`TypeError`.
