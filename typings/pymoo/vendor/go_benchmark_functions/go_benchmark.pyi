class Benchmark(object):
    """
    Defines a global optimization benchmark problem.

    This abstract class defines the basic structure of a global
    optimization problem. Subclasses should implement the ``fun`` method
    for a particular optimization problem.

    Attributes
    ----------
    N : int
        The dimensionality of the problem.
    bounds : sequence
        The lower/upper bounds to be used for minimizing the problem.
        This a list of (lower, upper) tuples that contain the lower and upper
        bounds for the problem.  The problem should not be asked for evaluation
        outside these bounds. ``len(bounds) == N``.
    xmin : sequence
        The lower bounds for the problem
    xmax : sequence
        The upper bounds for the problem
    fglob : float
        The global minimum of the evaluated function.
    global_optimum : sequence
        A list of vectors that provide the locations of the global minimum.
        Note that some problems have multiple global minima, not all of which
        may be listed.
    nfev : int
        the number of function evaluations that the object has been asked to
        calculate.
    change_dimensionality : bool
        Whether we can change the benchmark function `x` variable length (i.e.,
        the dimensionality of the problem)
    custom_bounds : sequence
        a list of tuples that contain lower/upper bounds for use in plotting.

            parameter.

        ----------
        x : sequence
            The candidate vector for testing if the global minimum has been
            reached. Must have ``len(x) == self.N``
        tol : float
            The evaluated function and known global minimum must differ by less
            than this amount to be at a global minimum.
