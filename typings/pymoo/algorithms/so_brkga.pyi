        Parameters
        ----------

        n_elites : int
            Number of elite individuals

        n_offsprings : int
            Number of offsprings to be generated through mating of an elite and a non-elite individual

        n_mutants : int
            Number of mutations to be introduced each generation

        bias : float
            Bias of an offspring inheriting the allele of its elite parent

        eliminate_duplicates : bool or class
            The duplicate elimination is more important if a decoding is used. The duplicate check has to be
            performed on the decoded variable and not on the real values. Therefore, we recommend passing
            a DuplicateElimination object.
            If eliminate_duplicates is simply set to `True`, then duplicates are filtered out whenever the
            objective values are equal.
