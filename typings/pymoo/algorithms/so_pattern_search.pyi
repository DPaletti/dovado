        An implementation of well-known Hooke and Jeeves Pattern Search.

        Parameters
        ----------

        x0 : numpy.array
            The initial value where the local search should be initiated. If not provided `n_sample_points` are created
            created using latin hypercube sampling and the best solution found is set to `x0`.

        n_sample_points : int
            Number of sample points to be used to determine the initial search point. (Only used of `x0` is not provided)

        explr_delta : float
            The `delta` values which is used for the exploration move. If lower and upper bounds are provided the
            value is in relation to the overall search space. For instance, a value of 0.25 means that initially the
            pattern is created in 25% distance of the initial search point.

        explr_rho : float
            If the move was unsuccessful then the `delta` value is reduced by multiplying it with the value provided.
            For instance, `explr_rho` implies that with a value of `delta/2` is continued.

        pattern_step : float
            After the exploration move the new center is determined by following a promising direction.
            This value defines how large to step on this direction will be.

        eps : float
            This value is used for an additional termination criterion. When all delta values (maximum move along each variable)
            is less than epsilon the algorithm is terminated. Otherwise, the default termination criteria are also used.
