    Algorithm Pseudo Code:

    1. X = the first node from a random parent.

    2. While the CHILD chromo isn't full, Loop:
        - Append X to CHILD
        - Remove X from Neighbor Lists

        if X's neighbor list is empty:
           - Z = random node not already in CHILD
        else
           - Determine neighbor of X that has fewest neighbors
           - If there is a tie, randomly choose 1
           - Z = chosen node
        X = Z
