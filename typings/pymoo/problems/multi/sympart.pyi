class SYMPARTRotated(Problem):
    """
    The SYM-PART test problem proposed in [1].

    Parameters:
    -----------
    length: the length of each line (i.e., each Pareto subsets), default is 1.
    v_dist: vertical distance between the centers of two adjacent lines, default is 10.
    h_dist: horizontal distance between the centers of two adjacent lines, default is 10.
    angle: the angle to rotate the equivalent Pareto subsets counterclockwisely.
        When set to a negative value, Pareto subsets are rotated clockwisely.
